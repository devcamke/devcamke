- 👋 Hi, I’m Dennis Kamau!

- 🚀 My primary focus is **Cyber Security Research**, where I delve into areas like:
    - **Malware Analysis**: Understanding and dissecting malicious software.
    - **Vulnerability and Penetration Testing**: Identifying and exploiting weaknesses to improve security.
    - **Technology Risk Assurance**: Assessing and mitigating technology-related risks.

- 📊 I also have a strong interest in **Data Analysis**, applying analytical skills to uncover insights, often within the security domain.

- 💎 As a **Rubyist**, I enjoy building and contributing to projects using Ruby and its ecosystem.

- 🌱 I’m continuously learning and currently focused on advanced threat intelligence techniques, secure coding practices in Ruby and machine learning for anomaly detection. I'm also continuing to develop my full-stack skills with Ruby on Rails, React, and Node.

- 💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on:
    - Cybersecurity research initiatives
    - Malware analysis projects
    - Developing security tools (Ruby projects are a plus!)
    - Vulnerability assessments
    - Data analysis projects with a security focus
