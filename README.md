- 👋 Hi, I’m Dennis Kamau!

- 🎯 My ambition is to become an expert at the intersection of **Security Research, Data Science, and Software Engineering**. I am passionate about building secure and intelligent systems.

- 🚀 In **Cyber Security Research**, I focus on:
    - **Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**: Understanding, dissecting, and neutralizing malicious software.
    - **Vulnerability and Penetration Testing**: Proactively identifying and mitigating security weaknesses.
    - **Technology Risk Assurance**: Assessing and fortifying technology against potential risks.

- 📊 As a budding **Data Scientist**, I apply analytical and machine learning techniques to extract insights and build predictive models, particularly within the cybersecurity domain (e.g., threat detection, anomaly analysis).

- 💻 As a **Software Engineer** and **Rubyist**, I enjoy crafting robust applications and tools, with a focus on secure coding practices. I have experience with Ruby and its ecosystem, and I'm also developing my full-stack skills.

- 🌱 I’m continuously learning and currently focused on:
    - Advanced threat intelligence techniques
    - Secure coding practices (especially in Ruby)
    - Machine learning for anomaly detection and security analytics
    - Deepening my full-stack capabilities with Ruby on Rails, React, and Node.

- 💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects involving:
    - Cybersecurity research and tool development
    - Malware analysis and reverse engineering challenges
    - Data-driven security solutions and threat modeling
    - Secure software development (Ruby projects are a definite plus!)
    - Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing engagements
